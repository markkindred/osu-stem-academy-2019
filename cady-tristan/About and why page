       <h2> You might be wondering who the founders of this website are. The founders of this website are named Cady McManus and Tristan MacDougall. Each of them noticed that STEM programs were frequently imbalanced in terms of gender and minorities.</h2>
       <h3>You may be asking why we made this website. As you may know, STEM is one of the most lucerative fields in any country. Unfourtantly, there are many inequalities in the STEM field for women and minorities. Many times, minorities and women don't have opportunity or exposure to STEM programs. It is also common for many girls to be lead towards carriers and jobs not related to STEM. Now a couple of facts from the National Center for Education Statistics. Out of all bachelor degrees awarded in 2016, 36% were given to women while 64% were given to men. For the awarding of bachelor degrees in 2016,the gap between males and females in Caucasians was 33 percentage points, 28 percentage points in Pacific Islanders,25 percentage points in Hispanics, 23 percentage points in Native Americans and Alaskan Natives, 21 percentage points in Asians and those of two or more races, and 11 percentage points in African Americans. </h3>
       <h4>Here's some more statistics about STEM.</h4>
